The goal is to create a basic recipe website for the odin project.
I started with index.html and created hyperlinks to 3 different recipes. Each recipe page comes with it's own Title, image, a description of the food, ingredients and steps to make it. I also added a "return to homepage" link under each recipe so you can return to the index.
